# PassValueTest
Isolated code for pressing a button on one page that sends a parameter value to another page. This is one way to utilize the My Progress page for the DuoDead project. This works by itself, but working with the rest of the code is proving problematic currently. I'm likely missing some calls somewhere. I just wanted to share this to show that I've been working on it and this is where I'm going with it currently.
